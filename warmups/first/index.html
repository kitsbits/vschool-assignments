            <p>Here's what my favorite website, <strong><a href="http://www.thisiscolossal.com/">Colossal</a></strong> has to say about the series:</p>
            
            <div class="grey-background">
                <p><span class="quotes">"</span><br>The Uncomfortable is a series of impractical household objects by Athens-based architect Katerina Kamprani. The infuriating works play off of common dishware, cutlery, and watering cans, making the task each is typically assigned either impossible or extremely difficult. Every object is created from the material it would be constructed from normally, making siamese wine glasses and linked ceramic mugs all the more humorous.</p>
